More than ever, our friends and neighbors in the greater Charlottesville community are turning to local nonprofits to supplement their basic needs.These organizations will face unprecedented demands in coming months to provide food, housing, and health security for tens of thousands of area residents. Local nonprofits anticipate requiring millions of dollars in additional funding to meet community need.

Scientists at UVA have already played a critical role in the COVID-19 response, from developing tests to PPE design and donation. We are offering another way for our community to mobilize in this critical time!

The Science Policy Initiative at UVA (SPI) has partnered with the [*United Way of Greater Charlottesville*](https://unitedwaycville.org/), the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation, and others to establish the **Scientists at UVA COVID-19 Community Fund**, an effort to demonstrate our commitment to step up and help local residents as a community at UVA. 

All donations go directly to the [*Community Emergency Response Fund*](https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/cacf-united-way-others-team-up-to-raise-funds-for/article_7108edb8-546f-5651-bbe0-fac1fc7dbed7.html). This is a centralized fund to provide resources to local families with little or no access to emergency funds, now and over the course of this pandemic.

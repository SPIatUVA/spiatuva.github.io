We are a student organization empowering graduate students and post-docs to be more informed and involved in science policy. Our organization seeks to (1) enhance awareness among graduate students in engineering and science disciplines about fellowship and career opportunities in science policy; (2) provide support and resources for graduate students and post-docs pursuing opportunities in science policy; (3) conduct professional development events to prepare graduate students for careers in science policy; (4) facilitate community outreach and advocacy opportunities to increase understanding of scientific research among the community and support evidence-based policies.

## Donate to our Scientists at UVA Covid-19 Community Relief Fundraiser
Local nonprofits that provide critical services to our community will face unprecedented demands in coming months to provide food, housing, and health security for thousands of area residents. They anticipate requiring more than a million dollars in additional funding to meet this need.
  
The Science Policy Initiative at UVA is pleased to announce the launch of the Scientists at UVA COVID-19 Community Fund, an effort to demonstrate our commitment to step up and help local residents as a community at UVA.
All donations go directly to a central fund to benefit [United Way of Charlottesville](https://www.unitedway.org/local/united-states/virginia/united-way-thomas-jefferson-area)

Over the coming months, we will continue to raise awareness about the heroic efforts of this and other nonprofits to ensure that every Charlottesville resident has access to basic needs during the pandemic.
Starting today, our funding goal is $10,000! Donate, track our progress here on our [Donate page](donate/){: .btn .btn--success}, or reach out via any of our emails or social media to learn more about partnering with us!

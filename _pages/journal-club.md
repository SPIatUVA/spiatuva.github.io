SPI at UVA has started a Science Policy Journal Club which currently meets **every other Wednesday at 5 p.m. (E.T.)** 

The goal of these meetings is to give participants opportunities to improve their policy skills through reading, analyzing and discussing topical science policy legislation. Specific focus will be placed on developing the following skills: A) rigorously interpret and analyze science-related legislation for efficacy, equity, viability, etc. B) practice debating and discussing proposed policy measures with colleagues C) develop “hard” skills that are required for successful policy-makers which might not be obtained during typical advanced science coursework. We are interested in the discussion of policy from all three levels of the U.S.Government – Federal, State and local.

For more information on the topics for upcoming meetings and source materials see the [journal club’s Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/113dftqG0SqnEo-5IdrJPI7PmTIk7eKvO?usp=sharing). 

To receive updates about meetings, or to participate in planning, running, or suggesting topics for future meetings, join the #journal_club channel in the [SPI Slack workspace](spiatuva.slack.com). Also, feel free to contact the Policy Education Chair, [Lucas Freeman](laf2ct@virginia.edu), with any and all questions regarding policy education through SPI!

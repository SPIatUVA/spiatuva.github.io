The National Science Policy Network (NSPN) has curated a database of the most up-to-date resources relating to science policy (fellowships, jobs, conferences, interesting reading, etc.). These resources have been made available to the public by NSPN and can be found [**here**](https://scipolnetwork.org/page/scipol-guide).

To get the most our of the network, you can join as an individual member [**here**](https://scipolnetwork.org/signup) and then affiliate with our chapter (SPI at UVA) in their great new online community. This will give you access to a wealth of curated information and resources, as well as the entire community of other early career scientists interested in science policy.

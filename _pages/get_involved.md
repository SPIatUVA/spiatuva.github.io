## **Covid19 Response**: 
More than ever, our friends and neighbors in the greater Charlottesville community are turning to local nonprofits to supplement their basic needs. Local organizations continue to face unprecedented demands to provide food, housing, and health security for tens of thousands of area residents. Local nonprofits anticipate requiring millions of dollars in additional funding to meet community need. Scientists at UVA have already played a critical role in the COVID-19 response, from developing tests to PPE design and donation. Another way for our community to mobilize in this critical time is to support these local relief efforts!

One major effort that needs your support is the [*Community Emergency Response Fund*](https://www.dailyprogress.com/news/local/cacf-united-way-others-team-up-to-raise-funds-for/article_7108edb8-546f-5651-bbe0-fac1fc7dbed7.html). This is a centralized fund established by [*United Way of Greater Charlottesville*](https://unitedwaycville.org/), the Charlottesville Area Community Foundation, and others to provide resources to local families with little or no access to emergency funds, now and over the course of this pandemic.

[*Donate and/or learn more about how to support these efforts!*](https://www.cacfonline.org/initiatives#:~:text=The%20Community%20Emergency%20Response%20Fund,nonprofit%20organizations%20providing%20critical%20services.)

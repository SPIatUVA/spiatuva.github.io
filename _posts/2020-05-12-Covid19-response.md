As the COVID-19 crisis rages on, UVA scientists are continuing to band together to help. No matter your research area, you can demonstrate your commitment to mitigating this crisis by donating to the Scientists at UVA Fund. [*Donate here*](https://app.mobilecause.com/form/Hn0mYg?vid=83fy3)! 

Current UVA partner groups supporting this effort include:

Graduate Engineering Student Council (GESC)
Women in Medical Sciences (WIMS)
Graduate Biosciences (GBS)
Graduate Biomedical Engineering Society Chapter (GBMES)
And of course, SPI!

Our fund is directly linked to Charlottesville Area Relief Fund (CERF), which [*recently donated $184,982 to cover May and June rent for public housing residents*](https://www.nbc29.com/2020/05/06/cerf-cover-may-june-rent-charlottesville-public-housing-residents/). CERF has done this and so much more to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on vulnerable members of our community. We’re relying on your donations!

Even if you can’t donate, please share with your networks and tweet with [*#ScientistsatUVAFund*](https://twitter.com/hashtag/ScientistsatUVAFund?src=hashtag_click).
